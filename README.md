# tinytask
is a daily task list for the things you have to do.

## Philosophy

### Write down tasks
Offload things you have to do from your working memory by writing them down immediately. Come back to the list later.

### Keep it simple
This space is small, made for tiny tasks. If it can't be stated in a few words, break it into smaller tasks.

### Mark a task as soon as you begin
Tasks that you have started will go to the top of the list. Use this to remind yourself of what to come back to.

### Don't stack up past tasks
Some tasks don't get finished. Important tasks will resurface in your life, and can be re-added or scheduled for a future date.
You can push a task to tomorrow or put it on a future list, but unfinished business will happily remain in the past.

### Mark it done
Keep a record of what you've accomplished. You might need it later.
It's also okay to put things you've already done on today's list.
